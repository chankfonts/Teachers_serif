Teachers fonts

DESCRIPTION

The Teachers Serif font is an educational font family created for use by publishers, teachers, students and parents of children in grades K through 6.

It is a clean serif font intended to represent the letterforms of the alphabet as American children are taught to draw them in grade school. Most notable, this font features an a and g that are more hand-drawn letterforms than typographic. The font family is made for use in books and magazines, but is also well suited for class worksheets, newsletters, websites and other instructional and educational purposes.

The Teachers Serif font comes in 2 styles: Regular and Bold. For Italics

The Teachers Serif fonts were assembled by font designer Chank Diesel, making edits and updates to the previously existing opensource fonts Sourcee Serif Pro (Regular and Bold) by Alfredo Marco Pradil of Hanken Design Co.
